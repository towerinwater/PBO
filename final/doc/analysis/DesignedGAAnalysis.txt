ANALYSIS OF THE DESIGNED GENETIC ALGORITHM'S PERFORMANCE

The GA implemented the prescribed framework of uniform crossover, mutation, and a parent population of at 
least 10. In addition, tournament selection with elitism were applied, choosing a mutation parameter 
of 0.01 and a constant population of 44 after repeated variation and testing of performance. 
The Leading Ones (F2) function appeared to be most sensitive to these algorithmic adjustments. 

All problems either reached or neared their pre-defined optimums using the designed GA. 
F1, F3, F23, and F25 achieved full perfomance; F18 reached 4.146, compared to its optimum of 4.216; 
F24 reached 19.4, compared to its optimum of 20; F2 performed the worst, reaching 87 compared to 
an optimum of 100.  

Observing the corresponding data plots, behaviour is consistent with that of previous optimisation 
algorithms, demonstrating exponential and asymptotic approaches towards the corresponding optima 
or maxima. F2's trials vary most from this trend, likely attributed to the relatively low number of 
independent trials (of the prescribed 10) that achieved the maximum. 


In comparison with Random Search....!!!!!
